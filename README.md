PGSwiss
=======

A Swiss Pairing tournament application designed for Warmachine/Hordes events.

Developed and compiled using Visual Studio 2013 for Windows. It's free!

The code is all VB.Net v4.5. I know, I know, C# this, C# that, blah, blah, blah... 
Truth be told, after over 15 years of developing in VB 5, VB 6, C++, C#, and VB.Net, 
I can still write faster in VB.Net.

At some point in time, I will put a license on this, but it will likely be a CC license. 
I have no expectations that 10 years from now I'll still be maintaining this, so if you want to take
it and run with it, be my guest!
